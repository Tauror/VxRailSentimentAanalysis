",Does anyone knows when the VxRail 4.5.070 upgrade becomes available for VxRail 4.0.302/4.0.400 customers? It would be released in Q4 2017. It's now almost 2018 and it's still not available for download.    Solved! Go to Solution. ,Since upgrading multiple vxrails to 4.5.227 in different locations we're getting frequent temperature alerts. When viewing the hardware tab the alerts vs what's being reported as the temperature doesn't match and often clears if I update sensors in the hardware tab. These vxrails weren't getting temperature alerts before the upgrade when they were on 4.0. Are there any existing issues with this?    Solved! Go to Solution. ,"Hi,I have two queries. Given vSphere 6.7 is now GA and with 6.7U1 due to be release at VxRail 4.7 in Q3 will there be an interim release with vSphere 6.5U2?
