Do NOT expect them to do ANYTHING but click through the xml script that they pre-bake to deploy your system.

Both were procured through a large reseller but we dealt with Dell EMC sales from the jump.  The sales process was a bit of a rough ride and the sales lead ended up leaving almost immediately after purchase (coincidence I guess). More to the point, we were always harping on the fact that the vxRail was to replace our current aging 'rack n stack' infrastructure. Our existing setup is not complex and very straight forward.  However, since it is in Production we told Dell team it was imperative to have a solid/flawless deployment which should emphasize the migration strategy to get us off the existing and onto the vxRails."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"Come to pass, after several calls with the new sales guy and tech, we are not happy - namely on the US side.

Normally, I couldnt care less but to charge a customer $6k plus for a 'Pro' install and then to find it is done over a 3-4 hour webex is a bit outrageous, especially if you break down the cost to an hourly basis. We have yet to do the install to date, but the other looming issue is, they are seemingly reneging on their promise to assist with a migration strategy.

We cannot really afford any down time and while we have a sense of how to conduct the migration, we do not think it's wise to do so without someone experienced with vxRail from Dell at the helm, or at least in the vicinity in case things go wonky, so they have direct line of sight to other Dell engineers.
