the TL:DR - What was wrong? 2 Things, it turns out. The first was basically as simple as upgrading from 1.32.3 that we were on, to 1.32.6 -- This took away the majority of metrics we were seeing really poor figures on. Latency improved, read throughput improved significantly. But, we were left with poor write performance. This last metric turned out to be R1Soft backup software! We'd only installed it recently, but essentially it installs a VSS writer driver, that captures writes, and well, it severely cripples write performance."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"So in short, the key thing was upgrading. It bothers me that EMC support (local) were unwilling to upgrade, and flat out refused to even acknowledge that upgrades were important. Repeatedly stressed that we would be best to resolve the performance issues first, then upgrade to a newer version. So that really set things back a lot."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"So the longer version of events. We installed ScaleIO back in September 2015, and went live with it around October. Benchmarks showed massive performance, hundreds of MBPS, hundreds of iOPS, everything spot on for our hardware. Once we moved our production systems over to it tho, everything went to shit."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"We had issues from the start, down to complete outages of the cluster, to the point that we eventually migrated all our VMs back to our old environment for a month or so. This was eventually tied to 2 underlying causes. One spinning disk was identified as fault, spamming SCSI bus resets. This caused the H730mini on that host to shit itself, effectively, which in turn took that node out of service. Since the SVM's for ScaleIO were also on that RAID card (later learned this is against best practice), it caused ScaleIO to not be able to detect this outage properly, and the whole cluster ground to a halt when it happened. Rebooting the host fixed the cluster, until the disk failed again."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"It bothers me that the PERC/iDRAC never picked this up. We only found it because I was physically AT the server when it happened and heard clicking sounds, and noticed one disk had a light on. The iDrac still through everything was happy. Dell claim this has since been fixed. Dell also claim the H730 won't be so affected by SCSI Bus resets like it used to either in newer firmware, but I'm not so convinced on that front."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"Dell replaced the HDD, and we got some stability back. We were now seeing very poor performance (as above and as per my other threads linked) -- We had trouble proving it to EMC tho, as benchmarks tended to come back with nice figures, but real world use was terrible. We invested a lot of time and effort into building up Grafana \u0026 InfluxDB to capture as many metrics as possible to be able to get a grasp on everything."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"We were still occasionally seeing issues where the whole cluster could be affected (copying multiple large files to a file server, for example could cause ALL VM's latency to blow out) -- Turns out this was H730 again. Since the ScaleIO SVM's were on the same PERC as the data disks, if the SAS bus got saturated, the SVM would lag out, causing the whole cluster to lag out."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"Dell came to the party here, and supplied us with 4 PCI H730's, 8x 300GB SAS drives, and a back-plane mounting kit to add 2 additional drives to our R730xd's. Once these were installed, the ScaleIO SVM's were moved here, and this did seem to solve this issue."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"This left us mainly with our performance issues. Eventually, in desperation my boss got escalated higher and higher within EMC Australia, basically to the point of threatening to throw ScaleIO out and get a new SAN. They started to take the SR seriously (it had been open since October 2015, and this was in March 2016 or so), but this basically led to daily phone calls, a lot of log capturing and gathering, and no real action. This is where EMC Australia were pushing the \"don't upgrade yet until it's fixed\" mantra."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"Around May 2016 we also started seeing instances of one node just going 'offline' for about 10-15 minutes, then coming back slowly to life. Occasionally it would also crash the ESXi on that box. Always the same node, but nothing was logged/faulted. We opened a second SR at this point, and this is what led to the 1.32.6 upgrade occurring, as it was identified that the crashing ESXi was a known issue in 1.32.3 and upgrading would resolve that."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"Finally, I made my more recent post on Reddit, where I wanted feedback on VSAN vs traditional SAN, as we were very serious about moving to a new storage system, and damn the expense, as our systems were crippled. This post got the attention of EMC America and people within ScaleIO in Israel. Very quickly I had some PM's and a couple of phone calls. Basically at this point within 2 days I had confirmation that a high level engineer from the USA was flying to Australia and would be on site to \"get this fixed\". And to his credit, he did. I promised him I'd post a follow-up here that all is well, so here we are.","f":[[2,533,6]]}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"He was on site for over 2 days, and put in some mad hours, even more so when you consider the jet-lag he would have been facing. By the time he got here, we'd had support to remotely assist us with the 1.32.3 to 1.32.6 upgrade. Assessment of that showed a massive improvement in latency, and throughput. Backups that took 48+ hours now took \u003C 24 hours (3.6 TB) , nightly backups went from 6-7 hours -\u003E 3-4 hours. Latency figures looked much much better. But still the writes were horrible. So we focused on that, and by trial, error and a LOT of testing, we identified that it was the R1Soft backup agent and it's VSS driver causing that issue. (Note: R1Soft had only been installed around March/April 2016 -- So if we hadn't had this installed, the 1.32.6 upgrade would have been seen to fix everything in one more)"}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"While the engineer was on site, the other issue of the host dieing happened again, but now in 1.32.6 we found the behavior was different. Thankfully, it no longer crashed the ESXi host, but it also didn't offline the whole node, the node lost its disks. All of them. All 23 disks on that node went into error state, then came back about 5 minutes later. ScaleIO one by one online'd them again, and everything went back to normal. So we got stuck into that one too with the engineer, and found that 1.32.6 also ups the logging and details (albeit, hidden away in a log file) -- Another failed disk. No error light this time, no noises, no apparant faults, just that one disk would go off, and take the H730 out with it, thus all the other disks also affected. Identified this by the facts that went ScaleIO re-online'd all the disks, each time it happened, one didn't come back online automatically. It could be done manually later on and it was fine, but then it would do it again."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"Dell again replaced the disk, and so far, touch-wood, we're back online without any issue."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"We've since asked support to assist us upgrading to ScaleIO 2.0.1, which has now been done. I don't see any major improvements in speed or latency, but the new UI and some of the back-end features are very nice."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"So all in all, EMC Support finally came through once we rattled enough cages, and about 13 months after we installed ScaleIO and went live with it, I have to say, I'm impressed."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"I wanted to love it from the start. On paper, it seemed amazing (all hyper-converged systems do in theory), and I wanted it to work. When the boss said he was over it and we just had to get something else, I was disappointed, but it's hard to keep defending even the concept of something if it is constantly causing performance issue, outages, and even ESXi host crashes! At a certain point, I was fearful of nighttime emails or SMS's, because I knew it would be ScaleIO having caused another outage somewhere and I'd have to stop what I'm doing, look into it, put it right as best I can, and then let my boss know. And I think the level of me hating those emails was only slightly less than the feeling of having to ring the big boss AGAIN at 9PM or later to say that AGAIN, storage caused a problem, explain how long it was and what the impact was to our clients."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"So, finally, now I can say I do love it. It's easy to use, it's great to manage, and the concept is still amazing. Virtual storage on a virtualised platform. And the scalability concept. We've got 4x R730xd's now with half SSD, half spinning disks. We know we'll run out of storage long before we run out of compute and RAM, but for the same price it would cost to expand a SAS by a 20 or TB, we can add in a 5th node of computer and RAM. Maybe we don't need it, but more hosts = more redundancy and technically a speed boost in some aspects too, so it's win win really."}],"e":"par"},{"c":[{"e":"text","t":"So thank's to
