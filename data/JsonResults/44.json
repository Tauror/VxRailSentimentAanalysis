The initial install went fine, albeit a lot longer than they market, it took the majority of the day with planning, DNS entries, racking, cabling, updating and initializing. After we got it up and running it was just performing horrible, we called VCE so the customer could see how his support experience was. And that's where it blew up IMO. The customer was working with VCE directly trying to get the issue resolved. We installed the VxRail on 1/26, on 2/3 VCE had officially punted blaming the network 100%. We came back in to help troubleshoot the network, we went through basic troubleshooting of moving cables to narrow down what port/cable it could be. The solution was that it was Port 1 on the NIC in Host 1. NOT the network... Now it's taken a few more days to get the host RMA approved with it scheduled to be replaced today on 2/10.
